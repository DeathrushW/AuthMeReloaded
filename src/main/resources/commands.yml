# This configuration file allows you to execute commands on various events.
# %p in commands will be replaced with the player name.
# For example, if you want to message a welcome message to a player who just registered:
# onRegister:
#   welcome:
#     command: 'msg %p Welcome to the server!'
#     as: CONSOLE
# 
# This will make the console execute the msg command to the player.
# Each command under an event has a name you can choose freely (e.g. 'welcome' as above),
# after which a mandatory 'command' field defines the command to run, 
# and 'as' defines who will run the command (either PLAYER or CONSOLE). Longer example:
# onLogin:
#   welcome:
#     command: 'msg %p Welcome back!'
#     # as: PLAYER  # player is the default, you can leave this out if you want
#   broadcast:
#     command: 'broadcast %p has joined, welcome back!'
#     as: CONSOLE
onLogin:
    welcome:
        command: 'msg %p Welcome back!'
        executor: 'PLAYER'
